🌍 Carbon Footprint Calculator

📌 About the Project

The world’s annual carbon footprint has crossed 40+ billion tons 🌍⚠️, driven by daily human activities like transport, energy use, food, and housing. This project helps individuals calculate, understand, and reduce their carbon emissions by providing insights and practical recommendations for a more sustainable lifestyle 🌱.

Everyday activities such as:<br>
🚗 Transportation<br>
💡 Energy consumption<br>
🥗 Food production & consumption<br>
❄️ Heating & Cooling systems<br>
all contribute to the surge in CO₂ emissions.

👉 This project aims to empower individuals by:

1.Calculating their daily, weekly, and monthly carbon footprints.<br>
2.Providing personalized insights into lifestyle habits.<br>
3.Offering practical recommendations to reduce emissions.<br>
4.Encouraging sustainable living practices 🌱.
